# [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
A daily programming puzzle series running through december. Previously there were 25 days (50 puzzles) but 2025 has only 12 days (24 puzzles).

## Personal Rules for partaking
My only rule is what I consider "real world setting" Google (and to a smaller extent LLMs) can be used for syntax and documentation look up. Never do I permit myself to search up the whole problem.   


For learning purposes I may input my solution(if already correct) into an LLM to see if there is a potentially more efficient/clean solution. but these will always be seperated and clearly marked.
